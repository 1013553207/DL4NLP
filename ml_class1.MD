### Definition of Machine Learning
A program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T & some performance measure P, if it’s performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.  
T - task  
P - probability of improved performance  
E - experience  

### 2 Types of machine learning
1. Supervised learning - you give the algorithm a dataset of “right” answers.  Example predict house prices in portland.
2. Unsupervised learning - no “right” answers.  algorithm finds structure. Clustering is an example of unsupervised learning. Examples: social network analysis, market segmentation, astronomical data analysis.  
*Reinforcement learning is a 3rd type of learning, not mentioned in this course.

### 2 Types of supervised learning
1. regression - predicting a continuous value attribute (house prices)
2. classification - predicting a discrete value.  Example: benign/malignant tumor, fraudulent or legitimate financial transaction, spam or non-spam email.



Many machine learning projects are prototyped in octave and matlab and production code is written in c++ or java.
